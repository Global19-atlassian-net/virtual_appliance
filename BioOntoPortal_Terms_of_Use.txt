Our Sites Terms of Use
Last updated: June 21, 2019

These Terms of Use applies to BioPortal and OntoPortal Web sites and services [“Our Sites”] that are operated by the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research [BMIR, “us”, or “we”], as well as to any BMIR software applications that you download or instantiate for use on your own systems [“Our Applications”]. We may update this policy at any time; if we do so we will revise the date and place notices on Our Sites if changes are material. We will obtain your consent if that is required by law.

BMIR is not responsible for the content or policies of sites to which Our Sites may link.

By using Our Sites, you agree to follow and be bound by the following terms and conditions concerning your use of Our Sites ("Terms of Use") and our Privacy Policy. We may modify or terminate our services from time to time, for any reason, and without notice.

The ontologies, terminologies, metadata, templates, and other resources provided by Our Sites may be downloaded in whole or in part and used, provided that 
  1. The end user follows the applicable licensing terms, including appropriately crediting the original provider of the resources.
  2. The end user has obtained the appropriate licenses required by the developers of the accessed materials.


Use of Ontologies

In general, any ontology submitted to Our Sites will be freely available for public use, unless the content is marked as private (in which case it is not shared via Our Sites) or the Licensing Attribute is defined in the metadata for that ontology. If an end user re-uses ontologies with a Licensing attribute defined, Our Sites consider it the end user’s responsibility to possess appropriate licenses for the re-use.  Only the submitter of the ontology (either an individual or organization who is the authorized owner of the ontology content or a designated representative) will be able to modify it or submit new versions, except that ontologies which are automatically ingested/updated by Our Sites may be changed at their source location on the web by anyone having that authority.

All submitted ontology content will be indexed and made available for search and visualization to all users of Our Sites worldwide.  Our Sites may provide an International Resource Identifier for each concept within an ontology so that the concept can be referenced in semantic Web applications.
